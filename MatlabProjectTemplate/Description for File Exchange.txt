Summary:

A template for creating repos for Matlab library and application projects




Description:


MatlabProjectTemplate is a template for creating Matlab library and application projects. It defines a "standard" project structure that should be suitable for many projects, including those intended for redistribution / open source.

Why does this exist? Because it's kind of a pain to create new Matlab software development projects. Just have a look at File Exchange: most of the projects there use "just a pile of M-files and maybe a README" as their project structure. That's not great for nontrivial projects.

MatlabProjectTemplate is suitable for both libraries and applications, and includes coding and organizational conventions that make it safe to use this project's code in a Matlab environment that uses code from other projects, too.

Features:

MatlabProjectTemplate supports the following features. You don't _have_ to use any of them; you can just ignore the ones you don't care about. But they're there if you need them!

* Collaboration between multiple developers
* Building Matlab Toolboxes
* Matlab Continuous Integration and unit tests
* Distribution as both plain zip files and Matlab Toolbox `.mltbx` files
* Using ("vendoring") third-party Java JAR and Matlab libraries
* Custom Java code
* Automatic library initialization
* Logging, in an SLF4M/SLF4J/Log4j-compatible manner
