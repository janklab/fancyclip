If you're going to post your project to MathWorks File Exchange, edit this file to contain what 
you want to go in the Summary and Description fields of its posting. That way you don't have to worry
about editing and formatting text in their little text field on the web page, and you'll have a
history of what you posted. Plus you can edit it ahead of time to your heart's content and then
just copy and paste.
