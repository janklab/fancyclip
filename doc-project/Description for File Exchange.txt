Summary:

Enhanced clipboard copy and paste for Matlab


Description:

Enhanced clipboard copy and paste for Matlab. Supports copying as HTML or JSON, pasting to Excel as tabular data, copying tables and structs, and more.

Matlab's clipboard() function is useful, but limited: it doesn't support structs or tables, and when you copy a matrix and paste it into Excel or similar destinations, you get the mat2str() representation of it, instead of a nice matrix layout. Fancyclip extends Matlab's clipboard() with support for all that stuff.
